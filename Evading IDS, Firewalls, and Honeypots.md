The adoption of Internet use throughout the business world has boosted network usage in general. Organizations are using various network security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and "honeypots" to protect their networks, which are the preferred targets of hackers for compromising organizations' security. Attackers continue to find new ways to breach network security and attack these targets.

As an expert ethical hacker or pen tester, you must possess sound knowledge of the functions, role, placement, and design implementation of IDS, IPS, firewalls, and honeypots used in the organization, as well as understand the process that the attacker has used to evade the organization's security in order to detect their intrusion attempts.

The labs in this module give hands-on experience in auditing a network against IDS and firewall evasion attacks.

## Objective

The objective of the lab is to evade the IDS and Firewall, and other tasks that include, but are not limited to:

- Detect intrusion attempts
- Detect malicious network traffic
- Detect intruders and their attack weapon
- Evade firewalls using various evasion techniques

## Overview of Evading IDS, Firewalls, and Honeypots

IDSs, which provide an extra layer of security to the organization's infrastructure, are attractive targets for attackers. Attackers implement various IDS evasion techniques to bypass this security mechanism and compromise the infrastructure. Many IDS evasion techniques circumvent detection through multiple methods and can adapt to the best possible method for each system.

The firewall operates on a predefined set of rules. Using extensive knowledge and skill, an attacker can bypass the firewall by employing various bypassing techniques. Using these techniques, the attacker tricks the firewall to not filter the generated malicious traffic.
