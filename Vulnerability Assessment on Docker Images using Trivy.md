1. In the **Parrot ** machine, click the **MATE Terminal** icon in the menu to launch the terminal.
    
2. A **Parrot ** window appears. In the terminal window, type **sudo su** and press **Enter** to run the programs as a root user.
    
3. In the **[sudo] password for attacker** field, type **toor** as a password and press **Enter**.
    
4. In this lab we will be scanning two docker images, first the secure one and second the vulnerable one.
    
5. Execute command **docker pull ubuntu** to install the first docker image.
    
6. Once the image is pulled we will be performing vulnerability assessment. Execute command **trivy image ubuntu**.
    
7. In the above screenshot, we can observe that we have total **0** vulnerability and it's completely secure.
    
8. Now, we will analyse the vulnerbale image. execute command **docker pull nginx:1.19.6** to pull the vulnerable image.
    
9. Execute command **trivy image nginx:1.19.6** to scan the image.

10. In the above screenshot we can see that we have total **401** vulnerabilities which is categorized as well along with **CVEs** mentioned.
    
11. This concludes the demonstration of vulnerability assessment on docker images using Trivy
