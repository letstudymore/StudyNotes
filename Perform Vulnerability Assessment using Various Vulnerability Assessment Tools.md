## OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a framework of several services and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low-level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans, and a powerful internal programming language to implement any vulnerability test. The actual security scanner is accompanied with a regularly updated feed of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs)-over 50,000 in total

Open a **Terminal** window and execute **sudo su** to run the programs as a root user (When prompted, enter the password **toor**).

Run **docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas** command to launch OpenVAS

After the tool initializes, click **Firefox** icon from the top-section of the **Desktop**

The **Firefox** browser appears, go to **https://127.0.0.1/**. OpenVAS login page appears, log in with **admin**/**admin**

The **OpenVAS Dashboards** appears. Navigate to **Scans --> Tasks** from the **Menu** bar

Hover over wand icon and click the **Task Wizard** option

The **Task Wizard** window appears; enter the target IP address in the **IP address** **or hostname** field (here, the target system is **Windows Server 2022 [10.10.1.22])** and click the **Start Scan** button

The task appears under the **Tasks** section; OpenVAS starts scanning the target IP address

Wait for the **Status** to change from **Requested** to **Done**. Once it is completed, click the **Done** button under the **Status** column to view the vulnerabilities found in the target system

Next, go through the findings, including all high or critical vulnerabilities. Manually use your skills to verify the vulnerability. The challenge with vulnerability scanners is that they are quite limited; they work well for an internal or white box test only if the credentials are known. We will explore that now: return to your OpenVAS tool, and set up for the same scan again; but this time, turn your **firewall ON** in the **Windows Server 2022** machine

Now, we will enable **Windows Firewall** in the target system and scan it for vulnerabilities

Navigate to **Control Panel** --> **System and Security** --> **Windows Defender Firewall** --> **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off**, **enable Windows Firewall**, and click **OK**

Click on [Parrot Security](https://labclient.labondemand.com/Instructions/0aafabcb-cfd4-4c46-9d80-748e2d1e35b4#) to switch to **Parrot Security** machine and perform **Steps# 7-9** to create another task for scanning the target system

**Report: Results** appears, displaying the discovered vulnerabilities along with their severity and port numbers on which they are running
