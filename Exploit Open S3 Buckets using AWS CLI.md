21. For demonstration purposes, we have created an open S3 bucket with the name **certifiedhacker02** in the AWS service. We are going to use that bucket in this task.
    
    > The public S3 buckets can be found during the enumeration phase.
    
22. Let us list the directories in the certifiedhacker02 bucket. In the terminal window, type **aws s3 ls s3://[Bucket Name]** (here, Bucket Name is **certifiedhacker02**) and press **Enter**.
    
    > The bucket name may be different in your lab environment depending on the bucket you are targeting.
    
23. This will show you the list of directories in the **certifiedhacker02** S3 bucket, as shown in the screenshot.
    
24. Now, maximize the browser window, type **certifiedhacker02.s3.amazonaws.com** in the address bar, and press **Enter**.
    
25. This will show you the complete list of directories and files available in this bucket.
    
26. Minimize the browser window and switch to **Terminal**.
    
27. Let us move some files to the certifiedhacker02 bucket. To do this, in the terminal window, type **echo "You have been hacked" >> Hack.txt** and press **Enter**.
    
28. By issuing this command, you are creating a file named **Hack.txt**.
    
29. Let us try to move the **Hack.txt** file to the **certifiedhacker02** bucket. In the terminal window, type **aws s3 mv Hack.txt s3://certifiedhacker02** and press **Enter**.
    
30. You have successfully moved the **Hack.txt** file to the **certifiedhacker02** bucket.
    
31. To verify whether the file is moved, switch to the browser window and maximize it. Reload the page.
    
32. You can observe that the **Hack.txt** file is moved to the certifiedhacker02 bucket, as shown in the screenshot.
    
33. Minimize the browser window and switch to the **Terminal** window.
    
34. Let us delete the **Hack.txt** file from the **certifiedhacker02** bucket. In the terminal window, type **aws s3 rm s3://certifiedhacker02/Hack.txt** and press **Enter**.
    
35. By issuing this command, you have successfully deleted the **Hack.txt** file from the **certifiedhacker02** bucket.
    
36. To verify whether the file is deleted, switch to the browser window and reload the page.
    
37. The **Hack.txt** file is deleted from the **certifiedhacker02** bucket.
    
38. Thus, you can add or delete files from open S3 buckets.
    
39. This concludes the demonstration of exploiting public S3 buckets.
